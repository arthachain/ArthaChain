## System Architecture

ArthaChain's architecture consists of several key layers:

1. **Consensus Layer**: Responsible for block creation and validation using SVCP (Social Verified Consensus Protocol) and SVBFT (Social Verified Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
2. **Execution Layer**: Processes transactions and smart contracts
3. **Storage Layer**: Persists blockchain data with multiple specialized backends
4. **Network Layer**: Manages peer-to-peer communication with custom UDP protocol
5. **API Layer**: Provides interfaces for external applications
6. **AI Layer**: Optimizes performance and detects anomalies

For a detailed overview of the system architecture, see [BLOCKCHAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md](./BLOCKCHAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md).
