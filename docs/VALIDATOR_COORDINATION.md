# Validator Coordination Guide

This guide outlines the procedures for coordinating validators during the initial launch of the ArthaChain network and during network upgrades.

## Network Launch Coordination

Launching a new blockchain network requires careful coordination among initial validators to ensure a secure and successful genesis.

### Pre-Launch Checklist

Before the network launches, ensure the following steps are completed:

- [ ] Genesis file is finalized and distributed to all validators
- [ ] Each validator has generated their node identity keys
- [ ] All validator public keys are collected and added to the genesis file
- [ ] Network parameters are agreed upon (chain ID, initial token distribution, etc.)
- [ ] Seed nodes are set up and their addresses shared with all validators
- [ ] Timestamp for genesis block is set in the future to allow synchronization

### Genesis Validator Requirements

To qualify as a genesis validator, a node must meet these minimum requirements:

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - 4+ CPU cores
   - 8+ GB RAM
   - 100+ GB SSD storage
   - 100+ Mbps dedicated connection

2. **Operational Requirements:**
   - 99.9% uptime commitment
   - Secure key management practices
   - Ability to upgrade promptly when required
   - Monitoring and alerting system in place

3. **Staking Requirements:**
   - Minimum 10,000 tokens staked at genesis
   - Commitment to maintain stake for at least 3 months

### Genesis Ceremony Process

The network launch follows this process:

1. **Preparation Phase (1-2 weeks before launch):**
   - Distribute final genesis file to all validators
   - Test connections between seed nodes
   - Perform dry-run of launch with testnet

2. **Genesis Ceremony (24 hours before launch):**
   - All validators start their nodes with the `--is-genesis` flag
   - Nodes sync the genesis block but do not produce new blocks
   - Validators verify connections with peers
   - Network reaches full connectivity

3. **Network Start (at genesis timestamp):**
   - When the timestamp specified in genesis.json is reached, block production begins
   - Genesis validators begin proposing and validating blocks
   - Network monitoring confirms stable operation
   - Public announcement of successful launch

## Network Upgrade Coordination

For scheduled network upgrades, follow these steps:

1. **Upgrade Planning:**
   - Create upgrade proposal with detailed changes
   - Set target block height for upgrade
   - Define testing requirements

2. **Validator Preparation:**
   - Validators upgrade node software with compatibility mode
   - Test on testnet
   - Signal readiness via on-chain governance

3. **Upgrade Execution:**
   - When target block height is reached, new rules activate
   - Validators monitor for any issues
   - Confirmation of upgrade success

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Network Failed to Start

If the network fails to produce blocks after genesis time:

1. Check that at least 2/3 of validators are online
2. Verify all validators have the identical genesis file (compare hash)
3. Check node logs for connection issues
4. Ensure system time is synchronized across validators

### Validator Cannot Connect to Network

If a validator cannot connect to the network:

1. Verify firewall rules allow P2P connections
2. Check that bootstrap peers are configured correctly
3. Ensure node ID and keys match those in genesis file
4. Verify network settings (chain ID, etc.)

## Emergency Procedures

In case of network halt or critical issues:

1. Join the emergency coordination channel
2. Follow instructions from the core development team
3. Prepare for emergency restart if required

## Contact Information

For urgent coordination needs:

- Emergency Channel: #validator-emergency on Discord
- Email: validators@arthachain.org
- Phone Hotline: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (for critical situations)

## Recommended Tools for Validators

- Network Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Security Management: YubiHSM or similar key management
- Alerting: PagerDuty, OpsGenie or similar
- Communication: Discord and Matrix (with encrypted backup)

By following these coordination guidelines, we can ensure a smooth launch and operation of the ArthaChain network with minimal disruptions.
