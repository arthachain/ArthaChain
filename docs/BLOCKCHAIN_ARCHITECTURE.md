# ArthaChain Blockchain Architecture

## Introduction

ArthaChain is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for scalability, security, and sustainability. The architecture combines advanced consensus mechanisms, AI-powered optimizations, and cross-shard transaction capabilities to provide a robust foundation for decentralized applications.

## Core Components

The blockchain architecture consists of the following core components:

### 1. Consensus Module
- **SVCP (Social Verified Consensus Protocol)**: Selects block proposers based on social metrics and contribution (compute, network, storage, engagement, AI trust)
- **SVBFT (Social Verified Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**: Fast finality based on the HotStuff BFT protocol, optimized for mobile and sharded chains
- **Cross-Shard Coordination**: Enables transactions across different shards
- **Adaptive Consensus**: Adjusts parameters based on network conditions
- **Reputation System**: Tracks validator reliability and performance

### 2. AI Engine
- **Fraud Detection**: ML models to identify suspicious transaction patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Adaptive monitoring of system performance
- **Data Chunking**: Intelligent data partitioning for optimal storage
- **Security Analysis**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Device Health Monitoring**: Predicts potential node failures before they occur

### 3. Network Layer
- **Custom UDP Protocol**: Binary serialization with minimal overhead for blockchain communication
- **P2P Networking**: Decentralized node discovery and message propagation
- **NAT Traversal**: Enables nodes behind firewalls to participate
- **DoS Protection**: Prevents denial-of-service attacks
- **Adaptive Gossip Protocol**: Optimizes message propagation based on network conditions

### 4. Storage System
- **RocksDB Storage**: Persistent key-value storage for blockchain data
- **SVDB Storage**: Specialized Vector Database for AI model data
- **Hybrid Storage**: Combines in-memory and disk-based storage for performance
- **Memory-Mapped Storage**: Fast access to frequently used data
- **Adaptive Compression**: Switching between LZ4, Zstd, and Brotli based on data characteristics

### 5. Smart Contract Execution
- **EVM Compatibility**: Supports Ethereum Virtual Machine contracts
- **WASM Runtime**: WebAssembly smart contract execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded transaction processing
- **SIMD-Optimized Execution**: Utilizes CPU vector instructions for performance

### 6. API and Services
- **REST API**: External interface for applications
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates and notifications
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and health monitoring
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible data querying interface

## Data Flow

1. **Transaction Submission**: Transactions are submitted via the API
2. **Mempool Management**: Pending transactions are validated and stored
3. **Block Creation**: Validators propose blocks containing transactions
4. **Consensus**: The network reaches agreement on the next block
5. **Execution**: Transactions are executed in parallel when possible
6. **State Update**: The blockchain state is updated
7. **Finalization**: Blocks are finalized and added to the chain

## Objective Sharding Architecture

The Objective Sharding system enables atomic operations across different shards:

1. **Dynamic Sharding**: TPS that increases with active miners
2. **Auto Shard Resizing**: Shards resize as miners join/leave
3. **Transaction Routing**: Determines which shard(s) are involved
4. **Coordinator Selection**: A coordinator shard is selected
5. **Preparation Phase**: Resources are locked across shards
6. **Execution Phase**: The transaction is executed on all relevant shards
7. **Commitment Phase**: Results are committed or rolled back atomically

## Security Features

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Resilient against malicious nodes
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Secure transaction and block validation
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns
- **Formal Verification**: Critical components are formally verified
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Protection against quantum computing attacks
