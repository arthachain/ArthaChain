# WebAssembly Smart Contracts

## Overview

ArthaChain employs WebAssembly (WASM) as its smart contract runtime environment, providing a secure, efficient, and language-agnostic approach to contract development. The WASM VM offers significant advantages over traditional blockchain VMs, including enhanced performance, formal verification capabilities, and quantum resistance.

## Architecture

The WASM smart contract system is implemented across several modules in `blockchain_node/src/wasm/`:

```

### WASM Virtual Machine

The core VM implementation in `vm.rs` provides the execution environment for contracts:

```rust
pub struct WasmVm {
    /// VM configuration
    config: WasmVmConfig,
    /// Cached modules
    modules: HashMap<String, wasmer::Module>,
    /// Wasmer store
    store: wasmer::Store,
}
```

Key features include:

- **Memory-Safe Execution**: Sandboxed runtime with strict memory boundaries (100 pages/6.4MB max)
- **Deterministic Execution**: Guaranteed identical results across all validators
- **JIT Compilation**: Just-in-time compilation for optimized performance
- **Bytecode Validation**: Strict validation of contract bytecode
- **Metered Execution**: Fine-grained gas metering for resource accounting

### VM Configuration

The VM is highly configurable through the `WasmVmConfig` structure:

```rust
pub struct WasmVmConfig {
    /// Maximum memory pages (64KB each)
    pub max_memory_pages: u32,
    /// Maximum gas limit per execution
    pub default_gas_limit: u64,
    /// Timeout in milliseconds
    pub execution_timeout_ms: u64,
    /// Maximum WASM module size in bytes
    pub max_module_size: usize,
    /// Features enabled for WASM execution
    pub features: WasmFeatures,
}
```

Default configuration values:

```rust
impl Default for WasmVmConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_memory_pages: 100, // 6.4MB (64KB per page)
            default_gas_limit: 10_000_000,
            execution_timeout_ms: 5000,       // 5 seconds
            max_module_size: 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB
            features: WasmFeatures::default(),
        }
    }
}
```

### Contract Execution Environment

The execution environment provides the contract with access to blockchain state and functions:

```rust
pub struct WasmEnv {
    /// Storage access for the contract
    pub storage: Arc<dyn Storage>,
    /// Memory for the contract
    pub memory: RefCell<Vec<u8>>,
    /// Gas meter for metered execution
    pub gas_meter: GasMeter,
    /// Call context (caller, block info, etc.)
    pub context: CallContext,
    /// Contract address
    pub contract_address: Address,
    /// Caller address
    pub caller: Address,
    /// State access
    pub state: Arc<State>,
    /// Current caller
    pub caller_str: String,
    /// Current contract address
    pub contract_address_str: String,
    /// Value sent with call
    pub value: u64,
    /// Contract call data
    pub call_data: Vec<u8>,
    /// Execution logs
    pub logs: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Host Functions

Contracts interact with the blockchain through host functions defined in `host_functions.rs`:

```rust
// Re-exported in mod.rs
pub use host_functions::{
    crypto_verify, get_block_number, get_caller, storage_delete, storage_read, storage_write,
};
```

These functions provide capabilities like:

- **Storage Access**: Read, write and delete contract state
- **Blockchain Context**: Access to block information, transaction details
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Hash computation, signature verification
- **Caller Information**: Details about the transaction sender
- **Contract Interaction**: Ability to call other contracts

## Smart Contract Development

### Supported Languages

The WASM VM supports multiple programming languages for contract development:

#### Rust

Rust is the primary recommended language for ArthaChain smart contracts due to its memory safety guarantees, performance, and rich type system.

**Example Rust Contract:**

```rust
use artha_sdk::prelude::*;

#[artha_contract]
pub struct TokenContract {
    total_supply: u64,
    balances: Map<Address, u64>,
}

#[artha_methods]
impl TokenContract {
    pub fn new(initial_supply: u64) -> Self {
        let mut contract = Self {
            total_supply: initial_supply,
            balances: Map::new(),
        };
        let deployer = env::caller();
        contract.balances.insert(deployer, initial_supply);
        contract
    }
    
    pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, amount: u64) -> Result<(), String> {
        let from = env::caller();
        let from_balance = self.balances.get(&from).unwrap_or(0);
        
        if from_balance < amount {
            return Err("Insufficient balance".to_string());
        }
        
        self.balances.insert(from, from_balance - amount);
        let to_balance = self.balances.get(&to).unwrap_or(0);
        self.balances.insert(to, to_balance + amount);
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    pub fn balance_of(&self, account: Address) -> u64 {
        self.balances.get(&account).unwrap_or(0)
    }
}
```

#### AssemblyScript

AssemblyScript provides a TypeScript-like experience targeting WebAssembly.

#### C/C++

For advanced use cases requiring maximum performance or specific optimizations.

### Contract ABI

Contracts expose their interface through a standardized ABI:

```rust
pub struct ContractABI {
    /// Contract name
    pub name: String,
    /// Contract version
    pub version: String,
    /// Contract methods
    pub methods: Vec<ABIMethod>,
    /// Contract events
    pub events: Vec<ABIEvent>,
    /// Contract constructor
    pub constructor: Option<ABIConstructor>,
}
```

## Contract Execution

### Loading and Execution

Contract execution follows a well-defined lifecycle:

1. **Loading**: Contract bytecode is loaded and validated
   ```rust
   pub fn load_module(
       &mut self,
       contract_address: &str,
       bytecode: &[u8],
   ) -> Result<(), WasmError>
   ```

2. **Instantiation**: An instance is created with the appropriate environment
   ```rust
   let instance = wasmer::Instance::new(module, &import_object)
       .map_err(|e| WasmError::InstantiationError(e.to_string()))?;
   ```

3. **Execution**: The specified function is called with provided arguments
   ```rust
   pub fn execute(
       &self,
       contract_address: &str,
       env: WasmEnv,
       function: &str,
       args: &[wasmer::Value],
   ) -> Result<WasmExecutionResult, WasmError>
   ```

### Gas Metering

Execution is metered to ensure fair resource usage:

```rust
const GAS_PER_INSTRUCTION: u64 = 1;
const MAX_EXECUTION_STEPS: u64 = 10_000_000; // 10 million steps
```

Gas is charged for:
- **Instruction Execution**: Basic computational operations
- **Memory Operations**: Allocation, reads, and writes
- **Storage Access**: Reading from and writing to persistent storage
- **Host Function Calls**: Interactions with the blockchain

## Security Features

### Memory Safety

The VM enforces strict memory isolation:

```rust
// From vm.rs
// Add memory
let memory = wasmer::Memory::new(
    &self.store,
    wasmer::MemoryType::new(1, Some(self.config.max_memory_pages)),
)
.map_err(|e| WasmError::InstantiationError(e.to_string()))?;
```

Key security features:
- Memory bounds checking
- Stack depth limitations
- Maximum module size enforcement
- Execution timeout protection

### Validation

All WASM bytecode undergoes rigorous validation before execution:

```rust
// From vm.rs
let mut validator = Validator::new_with_features(self.config.features);

// Parse and validate the module
for payload in Parser::new(0).parse_all(bytecode) {
    let payload = payload.map_err(|e| WasmError::ValidationError(e.to_string()))?;
    validator
        .payload(&payload)
        .map_err(|e| WasmError::ValidationError(e.to_string()))?;
}
```

### Formal Verification

The system includes tools for formal verification of contracts:

```rust
// From mod.rs
pub use verification::{ContractVerifier, LivenessProperty, SafetyProperty, VerificationResult};
```

Verification capabilities include:
- **Safety Properties**: Ensuring contracts behave as expected
- **Liveness Properties**: Guaranteeing progress under fair conditions
- **Model Checking**: Verifying against formally specified requirements

## Contract Standards

The system supports standardized interfaces for common contract types:

```rust
// From mod.rs
pub use standards::{
    ContractStandard, GovernanceStandard, SecurityStandard, StandardRegistry, StandardType,
    TokenStandard,
};
```

Available standards include:
- **Token Standards**: Fungible and non-fungible token interfaces
- **Governance Standards**: Decentralized governance protocols
- **Security Standards**: Enhanced security compliance requirements

## Upgradeability

Contracts can be designed for upgradeability:

```rust
// From mod.rs
pub use upgrade::{ContractVersion, StorageLayout, UpgradeManager, UpgradePattern};
```

Upgrade patterns include:
- **Proxy Pattern**: Delegating calls to implementation contracts
- **Diamond Pattern**: Multi-facet upgradeable contracts
- **Storage Migration**: Upgrading while preserving state

## Debugging Tools

The system includes comprehensive debugging capabilities:

```rust
// From mod.rs
pub use debug::{Breakpoint, DebugManager, DebugSession, StackFrame, StackTrace};
```

Debugging features include:
- **Breakpoints**: Pausing execution at specific points
- **Stack Traces**: Viewing call history
- **State Inspection**: Examining contract memory and storage
- **Gas Profiling**: Analyzing gas usage
