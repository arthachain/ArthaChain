# 10. Identity System

## 10.1 Decentralized Identifiers

Artha Chain implements a comprehensive decentralized identity system based on the W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) standard, with extensions that support the platform's unique social verification capabilities.

### 10.1.1 DID Architecture

The Artha Chain DID architecture provides a foundation for self-sovereign identity:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for organizational and personal hierarchies
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Interoperability with other DID methods
- **Metadata Framework**: Extensible metadata associated with identifiers
- **Controller Management**: Flexible control of identifiers
- **Lifecycle Management**: Creation, update, recovery, and revocation processes

These components create a robust foundation for decentralized identity management.

### 10.1.2 Identity Registration

Users and entities can register identities through multiple pathways:

- **Self-Registration**: Direct creation of DIDs by users
- **Sponsored Registration**: Creation by existing members

- **Organization Registration**: Creation of organizational identities
- **Application Registration**: Application-specific identities
- **Cross-Chain Import**: Importing identities from other blockchains

The registration process is designed to be accessible while maintaining security.

### 10.1.3 DID Document Structure

Each DID is associated with a DID Document containing essential information:

- **Controller Information**: Entities with control rights
- **Public Keys**: Cryptographic keys for authentication and signatures
- **Service Endpoints**: Access points for identity-related services
- **Verification Methods**: Ways to verify control of the identifier
- **Delegation Relationships**: Authorization of other identities to act

## 10.3 Reputation-Based Identity

A cornerstone of Artha Chain's identity system is reputation-based identity, which incorporates social verification.

### 10.3.1 Reputation Components

Identity reputation comprises multiple factors:

- **Contribution Metrics**: Assessment of positive network contributions
- **Longevity**: Duration of active participation

These components are combined into a comprehensive reputation profile.

### 10.3.2 Reputation Calculation

Reputation scores are calculated transparently:

- **Multi-Dimensional Model**: Separate scores for different contexts
- **Weighted Factors**: Importance of factors varies by context
- **Temporal Decay**: Older information has reduced impact
- **Progressive Trust**: Increasing reputation threshold over time
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns
- **Verification Depth**: Higher scores require more verification
- **Cross-Validation**: Correlation across multiple dimensions

```
// Simplified representation of reputation calculation
function calculateReputation(identity) {
    let baseScore = 0;
    
    // Contribution factor (0-40 points)
    const contributionScore = evaluateContributions(identity);
    baseScore += contributionScore * 0.4;
    
    // Longevity factor (0-15 points)
    const accountAge = getCurrentTime() - identity.creationTime;
    const longevityScore = Math.min(15, accountAge / (30 * 24 * 60 * 60) * 2); // 2 points per month up to 15
    baseScore += longevityScore;
    
    // Stake factor (0-20 points)
    const stakeScore = Math.min(20, identity.stakeAmount / 10000 * 20);
    baseScore += stakeScore;
    
    // Social connections factor (0-15 points)
    const connectionsScore = evaluateConnections(identity);
    baseScore += connectionsScore * 0.15;
    
    // Governance participation (0-10 points)
    const governanceScore = evaluateGovernanceActivity(identity);
    baseScore += governanceScore * 0.1;
    
    // Apply temporal decay to historical incidents
    const incidentFactor = calculateIncidentPenalty(identity) * getTemporalDecay(identity.incidents);
    baseScore = Math.max(0, baseScore - incidentFactor);
    
    // Normalize to 0-100 scale
    return Math.min(100, baseScore);
}
```

### 10.3.3 Context-Specific Reputation

Reputation is tailored to specific contexts:

These technologies enable privacy-preserving verification of identity claims.

### 10.4.2 Private Identity Claims

Users can selectively disclose identity information:

- **Age Verification**: Proving age requirements without revealing birthdate
- **Location Proofs**: Demonstrating geographic presence without exact location
- **Financial Status**: Proving financial requirements without revealing balances
- **Membership Verification**: Confirming group membership without identifying the group
- **Credential Possession**: Proving credential ownership without revealing details
- **Relationship Proofs**: Verifying connections without revealing identities
- **Threshold Proofs**: Demonstrating that values exceed thresholds

```
// Example of zero-knowledge age verification
function generateAgeProof(userDateOfBirth, minimumRequiredAge) {
    // Calculate user's age from birth date
    const userAge = calculateAge(userDateOfBirth);
    
    // Create a zero-knowledge proof that:
    // 1. The user knows their date of birth
    // 2. The calculated age from that date is >= minimumRequiredAge
    // 3. Without revealing the actual date of birth or precise age
    
    const witness = {
        dateOfBirth: userDateOfBirth,
        calculatedAge: userAge
    };
    
    const publicInputs = {
        minimumRequiredAge: minimumRequiredAge,
        currentTimestamp: getCurrentTimestamp(),
        ageRequirementMet: (userAge >= minimumRequiredAge)
    };
    
    // The actual ZK proof generation using appropriate cryptographic library
    const proof = ZKSystem.generateProof(
        AgeVerificationCircuit,
        witness,
        publicInputs
    );
    
    return {
        proof: proof,
        publicInputs: publicInputs
    };
}
```

### 10.4.3 Anonymous Credentials

The system supports fully anonymous credentials:

- **Unlinkable Presentations**: Preventing correlation between presentations

Anonymous credentials enable privacy-preserving verification.

### 10.4.4 Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

Multiple technologies complement zero-knowledge proofs:

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Computation on encrypted data
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Collaborative computation without data sharing
