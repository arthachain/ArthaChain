# 14. Security Model

## 14.1 Threat Model

Artha Chain's security approach begins with a comprehensive threat model that identifies potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors across all layers of the blockchain system. This model provides the foundation for defensive strategies and security mechanisms.

### 14.1.1 Adversary Capabilities

The security model assumes adversaries with the following capabilities:

- **Financial Resources**: Ability to acquire significant stake or computational resources
- **Network Control**: Partial control over network infrastructure (up to 10-20% of total bandwidth)
- **Colluding Parties**: Ability to coordinate with other malicious actors
- **Advanced Technical Expertise**: Deep knowledge of cryptography and distributed systems
- **Software Exploitation**: Capability to discover and exploit software vulnerabilities
- **Social Engineering**: Ability to influence human operators through deception
- **Long-Term Planning**: Patience to execute attacks that require extended preparation
- **Identity Creation**: Ability to create multiple identities in an attempt to appear as distinct entities

However, the model assumes certain practical limitations:

- **Cryptographic Bounds**: Cannot break standard cryptographic primitives
- **Network Dominance**: Cannot control more than 1/3 of total network infrastructure
- **Economic Rationality**: Primarily motivated by economic gain rather than pure destruction
- **Social Graph Limitations**: Cannot convincingly simulate extensive social connections
- **Computational Constraints**: Subject to fundamental computational limitations

### 14.1.2 Attack Vectors

The threat model identifies several primary attack vectors:

- **Consensus Attacks**: Attempts to disrupt or manipulate the consensus process
  - Sybil attacks
  - Long-range attacks
  - Grinding attacks
  - Nothing-at-stake attacks
  - Validator collusion

- **Network Attacks**: Disruptions to the peer-to-peer network
  - Eclipse attacks
  - Routing attacks
  - DDoS attacks
  - Partition attacks
  - BGP hijacking

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Exploitation of flaws in application logic
  - Reentrancy attacks
  - Integer overflow/underflow
  - Logic errors
  - Gas manipulation
  - Access control flaws

- **Cryptographic Attacks**: Targeting cryptographic implementation weaknesses

### 14.1.3 Risk Assessment Framework

Each identified threat is assessed using a structured risk evaluation framework:

- **Impact Severity**: Potential damage to network integrity, availability, or value
  - Catastrophic: Threatens entire system viability
  - Severe: Major disruption to network operation
  - Moderate: Limited disruption to specific components
  - Minor: Minimal impact on operations or value
  
- **Likelihood**: Probability of successful attack execution
  - High: Attack is feasible with reasonable resources
  - Medium: Attack requires significant resources or rare conditions
  - Low: Attack requires exceptional resources or highly unlikely conditions
  - Theoretical: Attack is possible in theory but impractical

- **Detection Difficulty**: Challenge in identifying attack occurrence
  - Immediate: Attack can be detected automatically in real-time
  - Prompt: Attack can be detected within minutes to hours
  - Delayed: Attack may take days to detect
  - Obscured: Attack may remain undetected for extended periods

- **Cost to Attack**: Economic requirements for successful execution
  - Low: Minimal investment required
  - Medium: Significant but accessible investment
  - High: Substantial investment beyond most adversaries
  - Prohibitive: Cost exceeds potential benefits by orders of magnitude

This framework guides the prioritization of security measures and resource allocation.

This approach, guided by a pragmatic threat model and continuously improved through rigorous testing and community involvement, enables Artha Chain to deliver a secure foundation for the next generation of decentralized applications.
