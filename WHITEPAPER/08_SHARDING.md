# 8. Sharding Architecture

## 8.1 Sharding Model

Artha Chain implements an advanced sharding architecture that enables horizontal scalability while preserving security and decentralization. The sharding model is designed to address the blockchain trilemma through intelligent distribution of computation, storage, and network resources.

### 8.1.1 Sharding Overview

The Artha Chain sharding architecture partitions the global state and transaction processing across multiple parallel segments (shards):

- **State Sharding**: The global state is divided across shards, enabling parallel state access and modification
- **Transaction Sharding**: Transactions are routed to appropriate shards for processing
- **Validator Sharding**: Validators are assigned to specific shards for block production and validation
- **Cross-Shard Communication**: Protocols enable secure transactions across different shards
- **Global Coordination**: Mechanisms ensure consistent operation across the entire network

This approach significantly increases throughput while maintaining security guarantees and reducing resource requirements for individual nodes.

### 8.1.2 Shard Structure

Each shard in the Artha Chain functions as a semi-independent blockchain with:

- **Dedicated State Space**: Subset of the global state managed by the shard
- **Shard Chain**: Sequence of blocks containing transactions affecting the shard's state
- **Validator Committee**: Group of validators responsible for maintaining the shard
- **Shard Consensus**: SVBFT consensus operating within the shard
- **Cross-Shard Interface**: Protocol for communication with other shards
- **Execution Environment**: Computing environment for transaction execution
- **Local Mempool**: Transaction queue for shard-specific transactions

### 8.1.3 Address and Data Partitioning

The global state is partitioned across shards using a deterministic approach:

- **Address-Based Partitioning**: Accounts and contracts are assigned to shards based on their addresses
- **Consistent Hashing**: Address mapping that minimizes redistribution during reconfiguration
- **Data Dependency Analysis**: Smart placement that keeps related data in the same shard when possible
- **Access Pattern Optimization**: AI-assisted placement based on historical access patterns
- **Context-Aware Distribution**: Consideration of logical relationships between data items
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of computational and storage load across shards

This partitioning strategy ensures efficient operation while minimizing cross-shard communication requirements.

### 8.1.4 Shard Count and Scaling

The shard architecture is designed for dynamic scaling:

- **Initial Configuration**: Launch with 8 production shards
- **Scaling Formula**: Shard count increases based on network utilization, validator count, and demand

This algorithm ensures that no shard can be compromised by a coordinated group of malicious validators.

### 8.5.2 Security Analysis

The validator assignment approach provides strong security guarantees:

- **Minimum Security Threshold**: Each shard maintains at least 100 validators
- **Adversary Model**: Resilience against up to 1/3 Byzantine validators per shard
- **Stake Security**: Sufficient stake in each shard to make attacks economically infeasible
- **Social Verification Layer**: Additional security through reputation and social verification
- **Unpredictability**: Validators cannot predict or influence their assignment
- **Rotation Frequency**: Frequent enough to prevent coordination, infrequent enough for stability

### 8.5.3 Validator Rotation

Validators rotate between shards according to a systematic process:

- **Rotation Period**: Validators reassigned every 2-4 weeks (epoch-dependent)
- **Partial Rotation**: Only a subset of validators rotates in each period
- **Continuity Preservation**: Ensuring sufficient continuing validators in each shard
- **State Transfer**: Efficient transfer of necessary state to new validators
- **Synchronization Process**: Process for validators to synchronize with new shards
- **Performance Consideration**: Rotation scheduled to minimize performance impact

This rotation prevents the formation of malicious coalitions within shards while maintaining operational stability.

### 8.5.4 Shard Committee Structure

Each shard is maintained by a structured validator committee:

- **Committee Size**: 100-400 validators depending on network size and shard importance
- **Role Differentiation**: Specialized roles within the committee (proposers, validators, etc.)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Multi-level committee organization for efficiency
- **Reputation Weighting**: Influence proportional to stake and reputation
