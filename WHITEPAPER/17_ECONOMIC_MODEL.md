# 17. Economic Model

## 17.1 Overview

The Artha Chain economic model is designed to create a sustainable ecosystem that balances network security, user accessibility, and long-term growth. Unlike traditional blockchain economic designs that focus primarily on token price appreciation, the Artha economic model emphasizes:

1. Productive capital allocation
2. Long-term value accrual
3. Alignment of incentives across participants
4. Efficient resource pricing
5. Inclusive economic participation

This section outlines the economic primitives, token mechanics, and incentive structures that form the foundation of the Artha Chain economy.

## 17.2 The ARTHA Token

### 17.2.1 Token Utility

The ARTHA token serves as the native currency of the Artha Chain ecosystem with multiple functions:

- **Transaction Fee Settlement**: Used to pay for transaction processing and smart contract execution.

- **Stake-Based Consensus Participation**: Required for validators to participate in the consensus process.

- **Governance Rights**: Enables participation in protocol governance decisions.

- **Resource Allocation**: Determines allocation of computational resources.

- **Social Verification Weighting**: Enhances the effectiveness of social verification when coupled with staking.

- **Collateral for Network Services**: Provides backing for advanced network services.

- **Protocol-Level Insurance**: Creates reserves to protect against unexpected events.

The token is designed to capture value from network usage while distributing that value to productive network participants.

### 17.2.2 Supply Dynamics

ARTHA has a predetermined issuance schedule designed to balance initial distribution needs with long-term economic stability:

- **Initial Supply**: 100 million ARTHA tokens at genesis.

- **Maximum Supply**: 1 billion ARTHA tokens, reached over approximately 10 years.

- **Issuance Schedule**: Decreasing emission rate following a modified logarithmic curve.

- **Issuance Allocation**:
  - 60% to network security providers (validators and delegators)
  - 20% to ecosystem development
  - 10% to protocol-owned liquidity and reserves
  - 10% to community-governed innovation fund

- **Supply Adjustment Mechanisms**: Governance can adjust emission parameters within defined bounds to respond to network needs.

### 17.2.3 Deflationary Mechanisms

To ensure long-term sustainability and value accrual, several deflationary mechanisms are implemented:

- **Transaction Fee Burning**: 30% of all transaction fees are permanently removed from circulation.

- **Stake-Based Burning**: Validators can opt to burn tokens to enhance their reputation scores.

- **Reputation-Weighted Rewards**: Higher reputation scores lead to more efficient token usage, effectively reducing circulating supply.

- **Protocol Revenue Capture**: A portion of ecosystem revenues are used to buy back and burn ARTHA tokens.

- **Long-Term Staking Incentives**: Rewards for extended lockup periods reduce circulating supply.

These mechanisms are designed to create deflationary pressure proportional to network usage, ensuring that the economic model becomes increasingly sustainable as adoption grows.

## 17.3 Fee Model
